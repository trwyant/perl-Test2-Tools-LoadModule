    Disable feature 'signatures' for Perl >= 5.20 because we're using
    old-style signatures. This is probably paranoia, brought on by the
    Perl Porters' talk of changing defaults for Perl 7.

    Added all_modules_tried_ok(). This traverses the specified
    directories (default: blib/lib and blib/arch) looking for modules
    that were not tried by load_module_ok(), and generating a failure
    for each.

    Added clear_modules_tried(). This clears the record of modules tried
    by load_module_ok().
