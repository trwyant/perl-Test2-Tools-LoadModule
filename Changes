    Add rt.cpan.org back to bug reporting methods. Long live RT!.

    they stay that way.

    Add CAVEAT section to POD, about false passes caused by the test
    routines loading modules that the module being tested needs but
    forgot to load. Also deferred the loading of dependencies
    Getopt::Long, File::Find and File::Spec until they are actually
    needed.

    Disable feature 'signatures' for Perl >= 5.20 because we're using
    old-style signatures. This is probably paranoia, brought on by the
    Perl Porters' talk of changing defaults for Perl 7.

    Added all_modules_tried_ok(). This traverses the specified
    directories (default: blib/lib and blib/arch) looking for modules
    that were not tried by load_module_ok(), and generating a failure
    for each.

    Added clear_modules_tried(). This clears the record of modules tried
    by load_module_ok().
